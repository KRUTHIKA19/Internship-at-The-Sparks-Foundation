# Internship-at-The-Sparks-Foundation

This repository contains the task I completed as an intern at The Sparks Foundation.

In this task I predict the percentage of marks of a student based on the number of study hours.

Data can be found at http://bit.ly/w-data .

This is a simple linear regression task and it involves two variables.

Steps involved: 1) Reading the data from source

                2) Input data visualisation
                
                3) Data preprocessing
                
                4) Model training
                
                5) Plotting the line of regression
                
                6) Making predictions
                
                7) Comparing the actual result to the predicted model result
                
                8) Evaluating the model
